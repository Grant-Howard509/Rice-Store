# Rice Store

## Motivation

As the bass player for the band Rice, I always loved to tour and meet people from all walks of life. But, tours are not cheap and can quickly become expensive.

Merchandise is one of the best ways any musician can provide value to fans, while also avoiding going broke on tour.

Having one centralized location where fans can buy our products would be ideal for the following reasons:

1. All merchandise does not need to tour with the band.
2. People unable to buy their favorite design at the show can do so at home.
3. Print-on-demand is available.

There are many Shopify themes to choose from, so why go headless in the first place?

I have seen many artists around my area use Shopify themes which is great! But for our band Rice, the goal is simple: provide the highest quality experience to the fans no matter what.

Having a headless website allows us to fully customize our shop in ways we could not be able to with a theme.

Although this project is still in its infancy, there is also talk amongst the band about the possibility of this project serving a dual purpose by being a band page and a shop.
